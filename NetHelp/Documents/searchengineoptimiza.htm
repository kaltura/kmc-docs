<p class="MsoBodyText">When the SEO (Search Engine Optimization) box is checked, 
the target page element includes metadata useful for search engines to index 
your page video content. The metadata is included using the scheme.org format 
that Google and other major search engines recommend using for documenting 
in-page content. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The content for these metadata fileds is pulled from your 
entry metadata. Its also recommended that you add facebook open graph xml to 
your page which is not included in the embed code because it must go in the 
header of your page. You can see sample Facebook open graph xml in any player 
preview page.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In some cases with Kaltura SaaS, SEO may also include 
Kaltura product definition links, please contact your account manager if you 
would like these disabled.</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
