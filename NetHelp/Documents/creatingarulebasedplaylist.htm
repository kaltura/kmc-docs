Based Playlist</h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A rule based playlist is a dynamic playlist that is 
automatically updated when content is uploaded or edited. To create a rule based 
playlist, you create a rule that selects the videos to include in the playlist. 
The rules may be based on the tags assigned to the videos, or you can create 
rules for ordering the videos and for the maximum number of videos to include. 
For example, you can create a “Most Viewed” playlist, a “Most Recent” playlist, 
as well as a playlist based on single or multiple filters, such as “videos 
tagged with “dogs” and created during January 2010”.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As you upload videos that match the rule, they are 
automatically added to the playlist.</p>
