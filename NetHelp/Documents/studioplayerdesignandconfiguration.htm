Configuration</h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Universal Studio enables users to directly customize 
Kaltura player toolkit players, also known as v2 players. The Kaltura Player 
Toolkit uses a unified HTML, CSS and JavaScript runtime to drive all 
players. This is a big improvement over the the Flash studio which only 
reflected the Flash UI and configuration. For a more complete list of advantages 
of the Kaltura Player Toolkit over previous versions see the<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="http://knowledge.kaltura.com/node/969">Kaltura Player Toolkit 
page.</a><span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>The Universal studio itself 
reflects these advantages and enables a much more robust configurability. The 
new studio provides many more powerful tools for player customization leveraging 
the player toolkits clean separation of JSON configuration, JavasScript 
components and CSS based themes. Finally, the Universal Studio is now directly 
connected to the feature set defined on <a href="../../Documents/player.kaltura.com">player.kaltura.com</a> avoiding any 
disconnect between HTML and Flash defined plugins. The Flash Studio is still 
available in this release.</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
