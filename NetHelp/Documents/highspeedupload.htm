<p class="MsoBodyText">Kaltura’s High-Speed Upload option powered by Aspera™ is 
targeted at content administrators (KMC users) that upload media to their KMC 
account. The High-Speed Upload option is particularly useful for content 
administrators uploading large source files or time sensitive content on a 
regular basis.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Aspera’s patented FASP™ Transport Technology is a proven 
standard for the high-speed movement of large files over IP Networks. It 
achieves speeds that are significantly faster than FTP and HTTP.  Please 
refer to <a href="http://asperasoft.com/resources/benchmarks/#tab-content-630-2">Aspera’s 
FASP Benchmark</a> information to learn more.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The High-Speed Upload option is activated by Kaltura when 
the High-Speed Upload option is included or added to your service agreement. For 
more information, see the <a href="http://knowledge.kaltura.com/node/737"> Kaltura High-Speed Upload 
User Guide</a>.</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
